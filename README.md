# Jamais Vu: Archiving Urban Soundscapes

### Concordia University - CART 461: Tangible Media Studio

**Team Members:** Lydia, Azhar, Louis, Noah, Kamyar, Rebecca  
**Instructor:** Elio Bidinost  
**Date:** October 1st, 2024

## Overview

**Jamais Vu** is an interactive installation project designed to evoke the sensation of unfamiliarity with familiar environments through soundscapes. The project collects and transforms crowdsourced audio samples from across Montreal, creating an immersive, sensory experience that challenges perceptions of urban spaces. Our aim is to engage participants in exploring and contributing to a living archive of the city's sounds, allowing them to reflect on the digitization of their environment.

## Concept

The project takes inspiration from theories like **Hauntology** (Mark Fisher) and **Hyperreality** (Jean Baudrillard), exploring the ways in which familiar sounds can be distorted to create a sense of temporal and spatial dislocation. Through the use of generative soundscapes, visual projections, and physical installations, participants are invited to experience a hyperreal version of the city, prompting critical reflection on how technology mediates their everyday experiences.

## Key Components

1. **Sound Database**: An ongoing, participatory archive of urban sounds collected via:
   - A web application where users can record and upload sounds.
   - Physical recording devices distributed around the city.

2. **Generative Soundscape**: The installation space uses sound processing techniques and neural network models (RAVE) to create an evolving auditory experience based on the sounds collected.

3. **Visual and Physical Installation**: 
   - **Projections**: Dynamic visuals designed using TouchDesigner, displayed on semi-transparent fabric sheets suspended in the installation space.
   - **Interaction**: Participants can navigate through the space, engaging with the visuals and sounds to deepen their sensory experience.

## Technical Requirements

- **Web Application**: Hosted on platforms like Vercel or Netlify, the app allows users to upload audio and tag their recordings.
- **Database**: MongoDB is used to store and manage sound recordings.
- **Physical Devices**: Custom recording devices built using Photon 2 microcontrollers, equipped with omnidirectional microphones and GPS modules for data collection.

## Timeline

- **Weeks 5-7**: Planning, app development, and preliminary device testing.
- **Weeks 8-9**: Prototype development, material testing, and sound processing.
- **Weeks 10-12**: Final testing, tweaking, and debugging.
- **Week 13**: Final presentation and installation.

## Research and References

- **Hauntology**: Mark Fisher’s *Ghosts of My Life* explores how contemporary culture is haunted by unrealized potentials of the past.
- **Hyperreality**: Jean Baudrillard’s *Simulacra and Simulation* describes the blurring lines between reality and simulations.
- **Cultural Perspectives on AI**: The study *How Culture Shapes What People Want From AI* informs our approach to engaging diverse participants through culturally responsive interactions.
